### Overview 
Used advanced CSS to make a sample portfolio

### Explanation of task
In this project, I started from scratch and used HTML and CSS to create a sample portfolio.  The goal was to follow a predetermined guide and duplicate a given image as well as make the website responsive to various screen sizes. 
 

### Benefit of responsive layout
By making a website have responsive properties, it allows a page to be viewable across various devices and screen capabilities without losing any capability.  Ideally the website should function the same whether it's being viewed on a phone, table or desktop.
  

### Personal benefit from making a responsive website
Prior to this exercise I was unaware of what made a website adjust between different viewport sizes.  While this project is a long way from being fully completed, it has taught me a great deal about flex boxes and media queries.  This is a topic that I plan to become more familiar with as my knowledge level increases.  In the future I would like to revisit this code and expand upon it.

There are also sections with "about me" information as well as samples of previously completed projects. The bottom of the page has basic contact information.](./Assets/Images/css_portfolio_1.png)(./Assets/Images/css_portfolio_2.png )
